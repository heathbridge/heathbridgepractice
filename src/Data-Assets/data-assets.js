They have to balance their time with treating the sick, keeping their practice afloat and making sure they are doing all of this safely and within their professional duties as a doctor. With certain exceptions written within their contract, doctors do not have to carry out non-NHS work. However, many choose to for the benefit of you and other families they treat. Where a doctor chooses to undertake the work, we advise them to inform and always agree a fee in advance of undertaking work. Should their volume of work prove to be greater or more complex than expected, the doctor will contact you to discuss how to proceed. "

Queries tend to be addressed promptly, and a recent appointment I had has been one of the best I've had since moving to the UK. The GP took time to really understand the patterns of my chronic condition and devise a plan with me to improve how it is managed. I left feeling heard, hopeful, and like I had an understanding of my care. Thank you!",

At the appointment, I struggled to find the lump again, but the doctor was really patient and assured me we could take all the time needed to find it and check it. Once found and inspected, I was referred to the hospital for a scan (thankfully it was just a cyst). Everything was handled professionally and quickly, making me feel reassured and at ease.",
